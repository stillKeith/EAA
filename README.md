Read me file for script for EAA.
this script should run the loadtest.c code 
this will put the server under stress
the for loop runs the code and the loop numbers is use as the
amount of users for the loadtest. 
then kill the process. 
the grep should check the syntiec file for the amount of transactions complete
finally it outputs the transactions coplete, users and cpu stress to a 
results file
